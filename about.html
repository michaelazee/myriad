  <h2>About Myriad</h2>
  <p>Myriad is an online publication dedicated towards sharing the stories of people of color in the fashion and entertainment industry. From fashion designers to actors to directors, Myriad sheds light on the work and accomplishments of POC in these industries, as well as their personal backgrounds.</p>
	<p>Additionally, Myriad also reports news on cultural appropriation and racial controversies, ensuring that these types of stories are not a mere fad of cancel culture.</p>
	<p>Unlike other publications, Myriad <i>only</i> publishes feature stories about people of color. This platform is not simply being created to appeal to this trend of "performative activism," it is something that has always been needed. The narratives of up-and-coming creatives should be heard by all in the fashion and entertainment industry, especially fellow people of color.</p>
	<p>Underreprentation remains a common issue in fashion and entertainment, so this platform allows those with a suppressed voice to become known.</p>

	<h4>Code of Ethics</h4>
	<p>Myriad is all about transparency and sharing stories that depict valuable and resourceful information to our readers.</p>
	<p>Our contributors must create a safe space for our interviewees in order to develop a relationship filled with trust and honesty.</p>
	<p>This code offers a standard set of guidelines that staffers at Myriad must abide by when creating stories, ensuring that every narrative we write is both factual and candid.</p>

	<p><b>Sources & Fact-Checking</b></p>
	<p>Always make sure that information is accurate before publishing an article by following up with interviewees and other resources.</p>
	<p>If using statistics or studies in a story, make sure that a) The author is a trustworthy source within that methodology, b) The poll/study comes from a verified organization (<i>not</i> Wikipedia), and c) There is no bias or relationship from where you got your source (i.e. sponsor, friend, etc.)
	<p>When interviewing someone, always make sure you explain "on-record," "off-record" and "on-background" to them before conducting your interview. Make sure that these quotes are accurately written and that nothing is obscured.</p>
	<p>If using a quote from another news outlets, refer to that source in your article. For example, "told the New York Times," "the Guardian reported," etc., along with a link to the article.</p>
	<p>Confirm with your interviewee what their preferred pronouns are for your story, as well as any other preferred descriptions about one's gender and sexuality.</p>
	<p>If a piece of information is incorrect after publication, the update must be disclosed at the bottom of the article, along with the date and an explanation of what the correction was.</p>

	<p><b>Race & Ethnicity</b></p>
	<p>At Myriad, making sure that identifying an individual correctly — especially in regards to their race and ethnicity — is crucial to this publication. The following is a style guide of language that should be used in all of our stories:</p>

<p>Always capitalize proper names of races, nationalities, etc.</p>
<p>Make sure that referring to someone's race or ethnicity is appropriate for your story.</p>
	<p>Always capitalize the "B" in Black.</p>
	<p>Never use discriminating words like "exotic," "oriental" and "colored" to describe someone's race and/or ethnicity.</p>
	<p>If you are mentioning someone's race or ethnicity, make sure it is fact-checked to ensure an accurate portayal of that individual.</p>
	<p>Never use insensitive phrases like "illegal alien" or "illegal immigrant." Instead, use phrases like "immigrant" or "asylum seekers" when publishing a story about immigration.</p>
	<p>Person/people of color (POC) is acceptable to use to describe people of races other than white. However, never use POC as an interchangeable term in a story that refers to more than one specified race, such as Latinos or Asians.</p>
